# Installation Instructions:
## Steps on how to install or set up the project.
###Downloading Python
Go to the official Python websiteLinks [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to an external site. and download the latest version for Windows.
The website automatically detects your operating system and gives you the right installer.

Now, go to your download folder and run the installer you just downloaded. Depending on your security settings, you might be prompted to allow access. Simply allow it and proceed. Once you have run the installer, you will come across this screen.
On the screen, you will see two options: Install Now and Customize Installation. We suggest you skip all customization steps and simply click Install Now.

Check on Add python.exe to PATH as it ensures Python is added to our system's PATH variable.(Recommended)
Click Install Now, as it will include all the necessary files needed later.
This makes it easier to run a Python Program from the command prompt (cmd) directly without specifying the full path of the Python executable. After using this option, Python will be successfully installed in your device.
## Files
#### A Net salary program file
This program intends to collect your Basic Salary and allowances and returns Gross Salary, Income Tax(PAYE), Income After Tax, NSSF and NHIF contributions, Housing Levy deduction and your Net Icome(Net salary). The returned values are calculated in Kenyan Shillings.
#### Grade generator
This program prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 
 A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
 #### Speed calculator
 This is a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
> For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
